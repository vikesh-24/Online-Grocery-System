A Shopping Cart page built using React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB provides a seamless and dynamic shopping experience. This application leverages the power of React.js to create an interactive and responsive user interface, allowing users to easily browse products, add items to their cart, and adjust quantities in real-time. The backend, developed with Node.js and Express.js, handles user authentication, product management, and order processing. MongoDB is used as the database to store user information, product details, and order history, ensuring efficient data management and retrieval. The combination of these technologies offers a robust, scalable, and high-performance shopping cart solution.
